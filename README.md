# AssemblyScript-vs-JavaScript-Benchmark

first you need to make sure you have Node.js 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/


then to get started with the app after cloning it, navigate to its location and use this in the terminal:

npm install

npm run asbuild

npm run test

npm run benchmark


Note: at the bottom of benchmark.js i commented the test cases to test one case each time, there you can choose which Test case you wanna start :)

then just retype: npm run benchmark to start the new case u choosed.

BTW: Thank u so much for everything Mr.Schmollinger, will never forget ur name :)
